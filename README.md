# scale-model
Scale model of asynchronous distributed system with logical clocks

## Usage

Download the source code or clone from the code.harvard.edu repo at https://code.harvard.edu/jah9590/scale-model.

When in the source code directory, run `python run.py` using **Python v2.7** (it may be necessary to run `python2.7 run.py` if your machine has more than one version of Python installed).

The scale model will then run without any supervision needed. Log files will be printed for the three machines in `log0.txt`, `log1.txt`, and `log2.txt`.
